Project Overview: AWS High Availability PHP Website with Auto Scaling and RDS
This project demonstrates how to deploy a highly available PHP-based website backed by a MySQL database on Amazon Web Services (AWS). By leveraging key AWS services such as EC2, RDS, and Auto Scaling, the website achieves high availability, scalability, and resilience.
The infrastructure is designed to auto-scale based on traffic, ensuring consistent performance under varying loads. Auto Scaling Groups ensure that a minimum of two EC2 instances are always running, with the ability to scale dynamically as traffic increases. A Load Balancer evenly distributes requests across instances to prevent downtime.
The backend MySQL database is hosted on Amazon RDS, providing secure, scalable, and highly available database services. The EC2 instances communicate privately with RDS, ensuring the database remains secure and isolated from external threats.
This project showcases the seamless integration of infrastructure automation, high availability, and scalability on AWS, making it ideal for businesses looking to migrate to the cloud with minimal manual intervention and maximum uptime. The entire setup is automated using Terraform, ensuring repeatable and consistent deployments.
